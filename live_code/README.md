# Live code

This is a cleaned up folder of our live code from lecture. 

## Most recently

All code from other folders, and other places we worked or demoed code can now be found in `live_code/` 
- most recently `OTHER_AR_week12/` contains the simple face tracking, image tracking (vs marker tracking), and soon the hand tracking
- Updates on combing more of the systems together to build differening levels of interactivity will be looked at in our last lab session tomorrow (Wednesday April 6 2022) 
- Also, Phase 3 - final submission of Group Project requirements - will be detailed in that lab session

## UPDATE POST READING WEEK

Most code content will be located at our Group Project repo/website documents from now on:

[gh-pages docs](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/GroupProject_info/tree/gh-pages/docs)

## PRE READING WEEK CONTENT INFO

1. JavaScript `p5.js` examples are in `/JS`
2. Python `processing.py` examples are in `/python`.

## What is in here?

We worked through:
- today 


## What can I do?

1. To run any `p5.js` examples - drag the `index.html` files into a browser window
   - remember `browser`-specific methods for allowing `sound`
2. To run any `processing.py` examples - you need `processing version 3.5.4`
3. The `mouse-click` `interactions` are associated with:
   - instant `colour` and `image` refreshes
   - prolonged `sound` - if held down

---

## Uh oh it's not working

1. Did you use processing 3.5.4?
2. Did the source for `libraries` location change for p5.js examples?
   - is there somehow a library being asked for in the `index.html` file but not present in the `libraries` folder?
3. Are you trying to use an old processing file (that didn't have the `sketch.properties` file encapsulated with the `.pyde` file - inside of a same named folder?)
   - update your local repo
4. Did you try it in `Firefox`? 
   - less things to do for sound (probably just works)
5. Are you in, or did you setup, `python mode` in processing?
6. Did you import the  `sound` library in processing?
   - have to manually add it through toolbar:
     - [S]ketch > Import Library > Add Library > 'search sound' > select `sound`
7. ? ask

---

## Try these

### processing.py

What happens when you change:

1. file


### p5.js

Replicate the python changes in JavaScript. 
   - Are there any subtle or not so subtle differences in the output?
