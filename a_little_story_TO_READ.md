# A little article I came across a few years back..

and seems to be relatable for us now. It helps to frame the technical and aesthetic of programming and code --- I've paraphrased it here but the link to the original article is included.


## `I’m a Developer. I Won’t Teach My Kids to Code, and Neither Should You.`

Programming requires much more than the cut and dry language taught in books.

What better way to prepare for a future ruled by software than by training on how to build it? If everything is going to be automated, it’s much safer to be the one doing the automating. And if learning to code is good, then learning earlier is better. 

> But while coding books may teach you specific coding languages, they actually have >>> _very little_ <<< to do with the work of creating software.

Maybe you've seen coding boot camps with the motto “Coding Is the New Literacy.” That sentiment is at the heart of all the programming books and games. The description in one popular book says starting coding early is “essential to prepare kids for the future.” This gives the impression that not teaching kids to code is somehow equivalent to not teaching them to read.

That is, of course, ridiculous. Coding is not the new literacy. 

> While most people are literate and know to read, most are _not_ programmers and have _no_ idea what kind of skills a programmer needs. 

Coding books often present coding as a set of problems with “correct” solutions. And if you can just master the syntax, you’ll be able to make things quickly and easily. _But that is not the way programming works._ 
- Programming is `messy`. 
- Programming is a mix of `creativity` and `determination`. 
- Being a developer is about more than `syntax`.

## An example

The (original) author, when starting out, once wrote some code to configure and run a group of remote servers. The code worked great. (At least that’s what they thought until about 18 hours later, when their phone dinged in the middle of the night telling them a group of the servers had failed.) Running to their laptop, they ran the code again to replace the broken servers. Hours later, a _different_ group failed.

_There wasn’t a syntax problem._ If there had been, the servers would never have been built in the first place. The problem was much deeper. Isolating and solving it took _several weeks_ and many nights of interrupted sleep.

|| **Coding is like that.** ||
- Try something. 
- See if it works. 
- Try again. 

Guess what? If a problem was straightforward, _it would be automated_ or at least solved with some open-source code. All that’s left is the difficult task of creating something unique.

## So how do we teach that?

Ever sit at a wobly table? Chair? You can probably look at it and isolate the problem: For example, maybe one of the screws is loose. So, you take a hex wrench and learn how to screw it back in. Rotate the opposite way and the screw would pop out. Grab some confidence and take the chair all the way apart... and put it back together. Do this again! Probably you often have mismatching pieces. But, maybe, just maybe you eventually re-discover the steps needed to assemble it to completion.
- Try something. 
- See how it works. 
- Try again.

## Of course, getting something working is just the first step of building software. 

The next step is to make `code` _clear, reusable, and neat_.
1. Clear.
2. Reusable.
3. Neat.

## Another example

Once, (the orignal author again) wrote a feature and gave it to a senior developer for review. The developer took one look at their sloppy spacing, mismatched lines, and erratic naming conventions and just said, “Do it again.” 
- It was working. 
- The syntax was valid. 
- _It was still wrong._

Good coders don’t just get something to work. _They want it to be good_.

That feeling of `quality` is the hardest thing for many developers to master. Well-designed code `feels good` to work with, and ugly code will make developers involuntarily cringe. The best developers _learn to fuse `abstract logic` with the `sensitivity` of an `artist`_.

> Learning to trust that aesthetic feeling is as much a part of development as any algorithm or coding pattern.

### Baking cookies

With every mix of some ingredient, pause and look at the dough. Think about the texture and colour. Is it smooth? Are all the parts mixed evenly? Roll out the dough. Feel the surface and understand what it takes to get everything even and thin. The hardest part for some, though, is cutting out the cookie shapes. Did you push the cutter right in the middle of the rolled-out dough? Try to explain why placing shapes next to each other in order will maximize each roll.

Every step - precisely measuring ingredients, gauging mixed dough for smoothness and consistency, placing precision cuts to minimize waste — can teach you about quality. 
> It’s hard to teach the difference between merely executing steps, such as following a recipe, and doing something well. 

It can only be passed on through feel and experience. And every time you work on something you value, you are given the chance to do things well. In a way, you are also preparing yourself to write code.

I don't just want to teach you that. I want to remind you the world is full of interesting things to discover. To show you how to be passionate and look for that ephemeral sense of quality in everything you do. The best part is that even if you don’t become programmers the same skills can be used in nearly any career, in every hobby, in every life. 

When we are forced to learn only syntax, we reinforce the idea that if something is not a blatantly employable skill, it’s not valuable. 

Anyone can learn syntax. 

Instead, learn to embrace `_curiosity_`.
