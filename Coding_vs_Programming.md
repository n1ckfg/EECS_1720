# Coding or Programming?

When you start digging into the world of development, you may hear both the terms, `coding` and `programming` thrown about. 
While these two words are often used interchangeably, they actually signify two _very different things_. 

In this course we start to look at `programming` which, as we might have seen from the first two weeks - is _significantly_ different than simply _working through lines of code_. It requires _different skills_ in addition to those required for and developed by `coding`. 

## What is Coding?

The language that computers understand is code, and code has been made into several different programming languages that both humans and computers can understand. `Coding` is _writing_ the programming languages in a way that will get the computers to do what we want them to do. Lines of code are called a script, and scripts create a program. To summarize, coding means writing many lines of code which will create a program. 
 
## What is Programming?

We know that to make a computer program, we need lines of code. _But that’s not all that is needed_. How do the coders know what to ask the computer to do? This is where the programmers come in. 

Programmers `plan`, `design`, `test`, `deploy`, and `do maintenance` on the `completed code` and `programs`. 

Programming involves the `bigger picture` of _creating an outline and structure to the program’s code, before the code is written_. After the code is written, the programmer needs to make sure it works and maintains it over time.

## So, what is the difference between `coding` vs `programming`?

### Programming Uses Higher Level Thinking

Programming involves making analytical decisions, changes based on current updates, abstract solutions, and anticipating problems before they occur. These are all higher level thinking tasks. Whereas coding involves translating actions into code — a much more straightforward task. 

### Coding is a Chapter in the Book of Programming

Much like each sentence, word, and character make up a book, lines of code make up a program. Programming is creating a plot, an outline, the story and structure of the book, and coding is writing the parts that will make up the book.

## What does this mean for us?

Coding and programming must work together in order to make a successful program. They are both vital pieces to the puzzle. First, a programmer plans the application from start to finish, then the coder translates those plans into code. The programmer puts all of that code together, tests it, and creates the final product. In our case, we will all look at being the `programmer` _and_ the `coder` - and we do this through the completetion of our _stand alone_ projects. This is where the difference really takes form - by creating self-contained working projects - they can be `published` as full programs. Programmers are `designers` and you can draw parallels to artistic practice here.

Does your work need to be incredibly world-altering? NO! It is the process and seeing something through to completion - while making _executive_ decisions in order to accomplish that `final stage` of `relased to public`, that is the goal.

We are not leaving `coding` behind! Rather we are _adding_ to this process by specifically requesting you start developing (or at least considering!) your _own_ motivations, reasons, and directed learning proccesses so that you can begin to move from `coding` and towards `programming`. To be successful in these technical skills _you must understand_ that this takes _signifiant personal responsibility_ to `practice`, `explore`, `learn`, and _ultimately_ `create`.

When you are asked to `think` about what you want to do _before_ you are shown or start your code - you are being asked _to `program`_. Why? You are being asked to `design` and decide on a _reason for coding_.

When you are given unfamilar code and asked to _change just one thing_ you are being asked _to `progam`_. Why? You are being asked to try and _understand the bigger picture_ so you can _make an adjustment_ and move on. This is similar to `maintaining` existing code inside of a `program`.

When we create our repos and are asked to follow a _specific format_, you are being asked to _to `program`_. Why? The consistent adherence to a `standard format` enables successful maintenance of a `program` and _allows multiple `coders` to contribute_ knowing that what they add will work within the confines of the program.

THIS WILL PROBABLY HURT (update: it did)!!

When we think about digital media, content creation, and designing our own projects, we have to consider the foundation of _how to handle the unexpected_. 

### Guess what? 

If you haven't already, it is likely that as you progress in your creative (both technical and artistic) pursuits - you will encounter situations _that have no ready-made solution_. It could feel _as if you have never seen a coding language before_ and that _you have no idea where to begin_.

There is _no easy way to experience this_. There is _no easy way to be that person_.

- What will you do? 
- How will you handle that? 
- Will you have the self-assuredness to push through? 
- Can you learn from it?

Experience and a willingness to experiment, all while removing any _fear of failure_, will go a long way in supporting your practice. So does knowing you've been in this position before.. and knowing you have worked your way out of it. We are here to help `guide` you in this process, to keep (or start!) you `thinking` about `how` you can _approach problems_ you encounter as you try to _get to where you want to go_... and to `identify` methods for `locating`, `using`, and `building` resources to help you along the way. We are doing this through a _critical lens_ of `new media` perspectives by _building interactive systems_ to work with `sound`, `image`, and `interaction`. 

While the code is important, the programming concepts are the reason. For anyone, but maybe particularly for students new new new to coding languages, ask yourself: Why are you here? It's required sure, but `WHY` are you here? What `motivates` you? `Why` did you want to `Digital Media` in the first place? Where do you get your `inspiration`? Why is this `beneficial` to you? The answers to these questions are personal - but _write them down_ and remember: if you feel anxious, lost, or otherwise unsure - take these words out again and look at them and think about why you want to learn and why you were motivated in the first place.
