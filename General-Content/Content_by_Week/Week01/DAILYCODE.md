# 100 Days of Code

Some ideas to get started with our _Day 1_ starter code

## If you need some ideas

1. go to the reference docs on [processing](https://processing.org/)
2. select a few commands
3. edit the code we ran today

You could:

  1. change the circles to squares
  2. add a colour
     - or 2 or 3
  3. try something you aren't sure of
     - save your work even if it doesn't `run`

### Expand the concepts

Replicate your _enhancements_ in both `python` mode and in the `p5.js` editor online (assuming you haven't setup your own server)

- `python` mode [ref](https://py.processing.org/reference/)

### JS and PY beginner tutorials

you are NOT expected to know this right now - but I added some links just in case you wanted to take a peek
