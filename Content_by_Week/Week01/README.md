# WEEK 1

## To do

1. github, fork p5.js
2. make a git repo for class on computer with app and push to github
3. make logfile, python folder, p5 folder, add info needed
4. make logfile to keep track with brief notes


## Some ideas for how

1. can init git in the processing sketch folder or make new one etc
   - we will do CLI next week
   - this way we can just copy the files we want to keep (just sketch etc and everything else stays on computer
   - also will make easier to follow your progress and check the updating
   - think about 100 days of code and what changes on github etc

## Where should I go for more?

1. processing website: JS and Python
2. get sublime or ? we will go into other examples next week when we do UI UE IDE CLI BUI
3. dl p5js complete example/empty example
4. enable python mode in processing
5. dl processing 3.5.4 install, enable python mode

## What did we do?

1. first sketch - show in p5 online editor
2. do versions quickly in sublime - push this
3. do version in python mode - push this

## How to get warmed up for code?

1. use references for p5.js and processing.py tutorials/basics 
2. students to pick 5 items from processing lists and alter both js and python examples to add something new
3. this will be how we will start the 100 days of code if you havent already

## What do I need to _definitely do_

1. first name last name github name discord name eClass/yorku email github email
2. fill this out and push min of 2 commits to github
